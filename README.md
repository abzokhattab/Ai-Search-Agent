In this project, We present a search agent that uses different uninformed and informed strategies to help Neo. Neo’s mission is to end up at the telephone booth with all hostages that did not turn agents returned (whether dead or alive) and, in the case hostages die and turn into agents, each hostage that turned into an agent killed.
An optimal plan is one where the deaths (of hostages) are at a minimum as a first condition. Given two plans with the same number of deaths, the more optimal plan is the one where the total number of agents killed is minimal.

Implemented Strategies
  1. Breadth-first search.
  2. Depth-first search.
  3. Iterative deepening search.
  4. Uniform-cost search.
  5. Greedy search with two heuristics.
  6. A∗ search with two admissible heuristics.
